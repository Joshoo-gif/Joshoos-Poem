The Peaceful lifetimes

Beneath the sky, so vast & blue,
The sun wakes up, its light anew.
The breeze whispers, soft & kind,
A gentle touch, a peaceful mind.

The river hums a soothing song,
Its waters dance, where they belong.
Among the trees, the shadows play,
Their quiet steps greet the day.

The meadow blooms in colors bright,
A living canvas, bathed in light.
Each petal holds the morning's grace,
A testament to time's embrace.
